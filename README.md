# rock-paper-scissors

Here is my rock paper scissors bot for my CS109 challenge project! It uses Beta functions to search for patterns in the user's play and adapts its play to try to beat them. The writup for the project is in the rps.pdf file, the code is in the rps.py file, and the data file is used to store model weights and graphs.
